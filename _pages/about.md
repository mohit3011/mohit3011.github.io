<p style="font-size=large;">
I am currently working as a Software Engineer(AI/ML) in the STCI Search team at Microsoft, Hyderabad (India). I work on applying NLP and Data Science oriented methods to create new experiences and improve the quality of answers shown for "Tech Queries" on <a href="https://www.bing.com/">Bing.com</a>, ultimately providing a better user experience. I like to work on impactful user facing problems!
</p>

<p style="font-size=large;">
Apart from the industry-driven work, I also work on academic research problems. I am mainly interested in the area of intersection between  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">Natuaral Language Processing (NLP)</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_social_science">Computational Social Science (CSS)</a>. Presently, I am working as a Research Associate at Geogia Tech with <a href="http://www.munmund.net/">Prof. Munmun De Choudhury</a> and at Precog@IIITH with <a href="https://precog.iiitd.edu.in/ ">Prof. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru</a>.
</p>

<p style="font-size=large;">
Previously, I graduated from <a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/">International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad</a> with B.Tech (Honours) and M.S in Computer Science and Engineering. I was advised by <a href="https://precog.iiit.ac.in/">Prof. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru</a> and <a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/m.shrivastava/">Dr. Manish Shrivastava</a> for my masters thesis <i>Towards A More Holistic Approach On Online Abuse and Antisemitism</i>.
