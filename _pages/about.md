<p style="font-size:large;">
I am a third-year CS PhD student in the School of Interactive Computing at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech</a>, where I'm advised by Prof. <a href="http://www.munmund.net/">Munmun De Choudhury</a>. Using computational techinques from Natural Language Processing (NLP) and theories from Sociology and Psychology, <b>my research takes a human-centered approach to evaluate and improve the quality of information on online platforms and produced through Generative AI technologies, emphasizing on attributes such as actionability, personalization, and linguistic appropriateness for aligning them with human preferences and requirements</b>.

</p>

<p style="font-size:large;">
In my dissertation, I explore the nuanced aspects of interactions between humans and online/Generative AI platforms, focusing on how variations in user backgrounds, purposes of use, and historical engagement influence the quality of information and services provided. My research aims to define and quantify low-quality information within these contexts in healthcare and mental health, establishing metrics to evaluate and improve these systems and make them safer to use. Through my research, I aim to uncover and reduce systemic issues within Generative AI technologies through systematic frameworks, providing data-driven insights to policymakers, researchers, and developers for creating more equitable, safe and user-centered AI systems.
</p>


<p style="font-size:large;">
Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer at Microsoft where I got an opportunity to work on NLP and Data Science related problems on Automatic Speech Recognition Systems and Bing. I graduated from <a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/">International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad</a> with B.Tech (Honours) and M.S in Computer Science and Engineering. I was advised by <a href="https://precog.iiit.ac.in/">Prof. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru</a> and <a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/m.shrivastava/">Dr. Manish Shrivastava</a> for my masters thesis, <i>Towards A More Holistic Approach On Online Abuse and Antisemitism</i>.
