<p style="font-size:large;">
I am a first year CS PhD student in the School of Interactive Computing at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech</a>, where I'm advised by Prof. <a href="http://www.munmund.net/">Munmun De Choudhury</a>. My research interests lie in the intersection of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">Natural Language Processing (NLP)</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_computing">Social Computing</a>.
</p>


<p style="font-size:large;">
Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer at Microsoft where I got an opportunity to work on NLP and Data Science related problems on Automatic Speech Recognition Systems and Bing. I graduated from <a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/">International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad</a> with B.Tech (Honours) and M.S in Computer Science and Engineering. I was advised by <a href="https://precog.iiit.ac.in/">Prof. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru</a> and <a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/m.shrivastava/">Dr. Manish Shrivastava</a> for my masters thesis, <i>Towards A More Holistic Approach On Online Abuse and Antisemitism</i>.
