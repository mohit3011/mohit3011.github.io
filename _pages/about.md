<p style="font-size:large;">
I am a second-year CS PhD student in the School of Interactive Computing at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech</a>, where I'm advised by Prof. <a href="http://www.munmund.net/">Munmun De Choudhury</a>. My research interests lie in the intersection of <b>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</b> and <b>Social Computing</b>. I adopt a human-centered approach to analyze the impact of online platforms and AI technologies (such as LLMs) on people using them. Combining computational tools from NLP and theories from social science, my research focuses on analyzing and understanding the quality of information consumed by people pertaining to critical domains such as healthcare, specifically addressing problems around misinformation, disinformation, and incomplete/partial information.
</p>

<p style="font-size:large;">
For a comprehensive understanding, my work aims to uncover insights related to human experiences and highlight potential harms, such as inequity and bias, stemming from the use of online platforms and both existing and emerging AI technologies. The overarching goal of my research is to empower individuals and communities by contributing to the design of fairer and more robust technologies.
</p>


<p style="font-size:large;">
Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer at Microsoft where I got an opportunity to work on NLP and Data Science related problems on Automatic Speech Recognition Systems and Bing. I graduated from <a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/">International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad</a> with B.Tech (Honours) and M.S in Computer Science and Engineering. I was advised by <a href="https://precog.iiit.ac.in/">Prof. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru</a> and <a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/m.shrivastava/">Dr. Manish Shrivastava</a> for my masters thesis, <i>Towards A More Holistic Approach On Online Abuse and Antisemitism</i>.
