abstract: 'Hate Speech Detection is an active area of research. Models trained on various hate speech datasets are used in real world scenarios to prevent users from harmful and disturbing content. However, these models suffer from multiple limitations that are often exploited by malicious users. In this work we aim to imitate different possible adversarial attacks and analyze the drop in model performance.'
